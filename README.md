# BE-CNN
Bit-Depth Enhancement via Convolutional Neural Network

# Instructions: 
1) Install TensorFlow(GPU);
2) Run 4-16/test_416.py to recover 16-bit images from 4-bit versions. 
   Run 8-16/test_816.py to recover 16-bit images from 8-bit versions.
   It will directly compress and reconstruct images from test/.
3) Results output to results_416/ or results_816/.
* The image size in the code needs to be changed.
